DataONE Java Client Library
---------------------------

d1-java is a client library for calling DataONE services. The library
exposes the DataONE services as a set of Java classes and method calls, and
forwards these requests to particular DataONE rest services.  The response
and exceptions are handed back to the calling application.  The library
makes it easy to utilize DataONE services without having to have a complete
understanding of the REST API.

See the test classes under src/test for example usage.
